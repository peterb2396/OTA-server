This project is a general but working scaffold to host firmware files with version control, requiring an OTP. 

The OTP is sent to the server owner, and when entered, the owner can upload a new version.
Products using the server can query it to determine whether they are out of date, and can pull the latest firmware.

This project was used as a basis for my MusicBox-web repo.
